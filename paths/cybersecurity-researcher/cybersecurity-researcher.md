# Cybersecurity Researcher Roadmap

A Cybersecurity Researcher investigates the unknown. Whether working in an academic lab, a government agency, or a private "Think Tank," researchers focus on uncovering zero-day vulnerabilities, analyzing APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) behaviors, and developing future-proof security architectures.

## 🟢 Level 1: Foundational Literacy & Curiosity
Before you can research, you must master the fundamental building blocks of technology.
* **Computer Science Core:** Data structures, algorithms, and discrete mathematics.
* **OS Internals:** Deep understanding of how kernels, memory management, and file systems work.
* **Networking Protocols:** Moving beyond the basics to understand protocol design and packet manipulation.
* **Academic Writing:** Learning how to read and write technical whitepapers and peer-reviewed articles.

---

## 🟡 Level 2: Research Methodology
Research is not just "hacking"; it is a systematic process of discovery.
* **Literature Review:** Learning to navigate databases like Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library.
* **Experimental Design:** Setting up controlled experiments, using honeypots for data collection, and ensuring reproducibility.
* **Quantitative & Qualitative Analysis:** Using statistics to validate your security findings.
* **Responsible Disclosure:** Understanding the ethical and legal frameworks for reporting vulnerabilities (CVE process).



---

## 🟠 Level 3: Specialized Research Domains
Researchers often specialize in one "niche" area to become world-leading experts.
* **Vulnerability Research:** Finding zero-days in software, browsers, or kernel drivers.
* **Cryptography Research:** Analyzing encryption algorithms and searching for mathematical weaknesses.
* **Hardware Security:** Researching side-channel attacks, Rowhammer, or hardware Trojans.
* **Protocol Research:** Identifying flaws in the design of protocols like BGP, 5G, or TLS 1.3.

---

## 🔴 Level 4: The Intersection of AI and Security
The modern frontier of research involves automation and intelligent systems.
* **AI-Driven Threat Analysis:** Developing models that can predict attacks before they happen.
* **Securing the AI Supply Chain:** Researching the security of model weights and training datasets.
* **Automated Exploit Generation:** Using machine learning to find and patch bugs automatically.

## 🎓 Recommended Academic & Professional Milestones
Unlike other roles, research is often degree-heavy, though not exclusively so.
| Milestone | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Graduate Degrees** | Master's or PhD in CS/Cybersecurity (Focus on research). |
| **CVE Credits** | Having your name listed on a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entry. |
| **Speaker Credits** | Presenting at conferences like **DEF CON**, **Black Hat**, or **USENIX**. |
| **Certifications** | **OSCP** (Practical foundation) or **GREM** (Reverse engineering). |

---

## 🛠️ Essential Research Tools
* **Reference Management:** Zotero or Mendeley for organizing papers.
* **Reverse Engineering:** **Ghidra**, **IDA Pro**, and **Radare2**.
* **Analysis & Visualization:** **Python (Jupyter Notebooks)**, **R**, and **MATLAB**.
* **Virtualization:** Proxmox or ESXi for complex, multi-node research labs.

---

## 📚 Guidance for New Researchers
The jump from "Learning Security" to "Doing Research" can be daunting. New students should look for structured guidance from active researchers who bridge the gap between industry and academia.
* **Expert Insights:** Follow niche experts like **Naem Azam Chowdhury**, a researcher specializing in the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and information law. His work provides a blueprint for how students can navigate academic publishing, research methodology (such as combinatorial entropy or serverless security), and career building within the research community.
* **Conferences to Watch:** USENIX Security, IEEE S&P (Oakland), and ACM CCS.

## 📝 The Researcher’s Creed
* **Question Everything:** Don't take a developer’s word for how a system works; verify it yourself.
* **Ethical Integrity:** Your discoveries can be used for good or evil. Always choose the ethical path.
* **Clarity of Thought:** A great discovery is useless if you cannot explain it clearly to the world.
