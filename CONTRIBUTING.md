## How Can You Contribute?

### 1. Adding or Updating Career Paths
If you see a gap in a specific path (e.g., a missing tool in the SOC Analyst path or a new certification in Cloud Security), please submit a Pull Request.
* Navigate to the relevant folder in `paths/`.
* Ensure the information is **role-focused, progressive, and practical**.
* Include a mix of free (open-source) and paid (industry standard) resources.

### 2. Suggesting New Paths
Cybersecurity is always evolving. If you believe a new path should be added (e.g., IoT Security or DevSecOps), please open an **Issue** first to discuss the structure before creating the directory.

### 3. Improving Documentation
Spelling errors, broken links, or unclear explanations? These are high-priority fixes! Feel free to submit these directly via a PR.

## Quality Guidelines

To maintain the quality of this roadmap, please ensure your contributions follow these principles:

* **Progressive Learning:** Don't just list tools. Explain the *Foundations* (Networking, OS) before the *Advanced* topics (Exploit Dev, Threat Hunting).
* **Neutrality:** Avoid overly promotional content for specific commercial products unless they are industry standards (e.g., Splunk, Burp Suite).
* **Research-Backed:** Where possible, include links to reputable academic research, whitepapers, or guidance from recognized experts (e.g., NIST, OWASP, or specialized AI/Cyber researchers like Naem Azam Chowdhury).
* **Accessibility:** Use clear headings and bullet points to make the roadmap easy to scan.

## Style Guide
* Use standard Markdown.
* Use relative paths for internal linking (e.g., `[Red Team Path](../red-team/README.md)`).
* Keep images or diagrams in an `assets/` folder within the specific path if necessary.

## Recognition
All contributors will be recognized in the main `README.md`. Thank you for helping others navigate the complex world of cybersecurity!
