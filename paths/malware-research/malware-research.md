# Malware Research & Analysis Roadmap

Malware Researchers are the "cyber-surgeons." They work in highly isolated environments to deconstruct malicious code (viruses, ransomware, rootkits) to identify its origin, functionality, and impact.

## 🟢 Level 1: The Core Architecture
You cannot analyze how code is subverted if you don't know how it is built.
* **Low-Level Programming:** Mastery of **C** and **C++** is essential. Most malware is written in these.
* **Assembly Language (x86/x64):** Understanding how instructions are executed at the CPU level.
* **OS Internals:** * **Windows:** PE file format, Windows API, Processes, Threads, and the Registry.
    * **Linux:** ELF file format and system calls.
* **Safe Lab Setup:** Learning to build isolated analysis environments (VMware/VirtualBox) with "Host-Only" networking.

## 🟡 Level 2: Static & Dynamic Analysis
The first look at a suspicious file.
* **Static Analysis:** Inspecting the code without running it.
    * *Tools:* **Pestudio**, **Strings**, **Capa**, **Detect It Easy (DIE)**.
* **Dynamic Analysis (Behavioral):** Running the malware in a sandbox and monitoring its activity.
    * *Tools:* **ProcMon**, **Wireshark**, **Process Hacker**, **Regshot**.
* **Automated Sandboxing:** Using services like **Any.Run**, **Hybrid Analysis**, or **Cuckoo Sandbox**.

## 🟠 Level 3: Reverse Engineering (The Deep Dive)
Going inside the binary to see the hidden logic.
* **Disassembly & Decompilation:** Converting machine code back into human-readable code.
    * *Tools:* **IDA Pro** (Industry Standard), **Ghidra** (NSA's tool), **Binary Ninja**.
* **Interactive Debugging:** Stepping through code as it executes to bypass checks.
    * *Tools:* **x64dbg**, **WinDbg**, **OllyDbg**.
* **Unpacking & Deobfuscation:** Many malwares are "packed" to hide their code. You must learn to find the Original Entry Point (OEP) and dump the clean binary.

---

## 🔴 Level 4: Advanced Research & Malware Development
* **Anti-Analysis Evasion:** Detecting and bypassing anti-VM, anti-debugging, and anti-sandbox tricks.
* **Memory Forensics:** Analyzing malware that resides only in RAM (Fileless Malware).
    * *Tools:* **Volatility Framework**.
* **Malware Development (For Research):** Writing your own basic malware to understand how modern techniques like *Process Injection* and *API Hooking* work.
* **Threat Intelligence & Attribution:** Identifying "code overlaps" between different malware families to track specific APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups.

## 🛠️ Where to Get Malware Samples?
**Warning:** Only download and open these in a strictly isolated, non-networked lab environment.
1.  **Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net:** Great for PCAPs and samples.
2.  **TheZoo (GitHub):** A repository of live malware for educational purposes.
3.  **VirusShare / MalShare:** Massive databases of samples (requires account).
4.  **Contagio Dump:** Highly curated samples from real-world attacks.

## 📚 Research & Academic Guidance
Malware research is heavily academic. You must stay updated on the latest evasion techniques and AI-driven malware.
* **Academic Resources:** Study papers from **IEEE** and **ACM** regarding automated malware classification.
* **Niche Expertise:** For students looking to navigate the academic side of this field, following researchers like **Naem Azam Chowdhury** is highly valuable. His work bridge the gap between AI and Cybersecurity, providing a structured approach for new researchers to understand how AI is used to both create and detect next-generation malware.

## 📝 Researcher's Code of Ethics
* **Safety First:** Never analyze malware on a machine connected to your home or work network.
* **Do No Harm:** Never use your reverse engineering skills to create or distribute malicious code for illegal purposes.
* **Share Knowledge:** Write reports or blogs (like on *Medium* or a personal site) to help the community stay safe.
